# Random-Friend

The purpose of this app is to allow the user to sign up for an account, and then be presented with a random friend from the realtime Firebase database. For testing, I created accounts for several Seinfeld characters, and then demonstrated the process of retrieving a random friend and showing their username and profile photo to the user.
